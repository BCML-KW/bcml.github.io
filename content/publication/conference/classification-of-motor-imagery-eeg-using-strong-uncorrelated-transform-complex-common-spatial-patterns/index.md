abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the disassociation between the mu and beta
  rhythms of electroencephalogram (EEG) during motor imagery tasks. The proposed algorithm
  in this paper uses a fully data-driven multivariate empirical mode decomposition
  (MEMD) in order to obtain the mu and beta rhythms from the nonlinear EEG signals.
  Then, the strong uncorrelating transform complex common spatial patterns (SUTCCSP)
  algorithm is applied to the rhythms so that the complex data, constructed with the
  mu and beta rhythms, becomes uncorrelated and its pseudocovariance provides supplementary
  power difference information between the two rhythms. The extracted features using
  SUTCCSP that maximize the interclass variances are classified using various classification
  algorithms for the separation of the left- and right-hand motor imagery EEG acquired
  from the Physionet database. This paper shows that the supplementary information
  of the power difference between mu and beta rhythms obtained using SUTCCSP provides
  an important feature for the classification of the left- and right-hand motor imagery
  tasks. In addition, MEMD is proved to be a preferred preprocessing method for the
  nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals compared to the conventional IIR filtering.
  Finally, the random forest classifier yielded a high performance for the classification
  of the motor imagery tasks.
