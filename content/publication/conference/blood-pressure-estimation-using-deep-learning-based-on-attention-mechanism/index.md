abstract: "Abstract\n        Recently, several studies have proposed methods for measuring\
  \ cuffless blood pressure (BP) using finger photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. This\
  \ study presents a new BP estimation system that measures PPG signals under progressive\
  \ finger pressure, making the system relatively robust to errors caused by finger\
  \ position when using the cuffless oscillometric method. To reduce errors caused\
  \ by finger position, we developed a sensor that can simultaneously measure multi-channel\
  \ PPG and force signals in a wide field of view (FOV). We propose a deep-learning-based\
  \ algorithm that can learn to focus on the optimal PPG channel from multi channel\
  \ PPG using an attention mechanism. The errors (ME±STD) of the proposed multi channel\
  \ system were 0.43±9.35 mmHg and 0.21±7.72 mmHg for SBP and DBP, respectively. Through\
  \ extensive experiments, we found a significant performance difference depending\
  \ on the location of the PPG measurement in the BP estimation system using finger\
  \ pressure."
