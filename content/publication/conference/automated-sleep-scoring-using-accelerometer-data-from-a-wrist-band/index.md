abstract: "AbstractAccurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both\
  \ clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are\
  \ widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates\
  \ of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer\
  \ data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential\
  \ of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three\
  \ different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64\
  \ good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night\
  \ polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish\
  \ sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93% on a previously unseen test set of\
  \ 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful\
  \ using machine learning ($$\\hbox {F1-score} &gt; 93.31\\%$$\n                \
  \  \n                    F1-score\n                    &gt;\n                  \
  \  93.31\n                    %\n                  \n                ), and when\
  \ combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate\
  \ that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour ($$\\hbox {r}=.60$$\n\
  \                  \n                    r\n                    =\n            \
  \        .\n                    60\n                  \n                ). These\
  \ Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line\
  \ with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only\
  \ accelerometer data."
